      %h4.marker About this Application

      %p
        For developers who have done software planning in an Agile process,
        this application should feel familiar. The application provides
        a collaborative space for developers to discuss, vote, and
        reach consensus on the complexity of a task. For example:

      %ul.fa-ul
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-right.fa-border
          Leader: "The next task under discussion is WIDGET-193, adding a 'like' button to the widget interface"
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-left.fa-border
          Developer A: "Does this include the 'like' frontend and backend?"
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-right.fa-border
          Leader: "Yes - good clarification. Any other questions?"
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-left.fa-border
          Developers A, B, C, D: "Nope. All set!"
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-right.fa-border
          Leader: "OK, let's vote."
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-left.fa-border
          Developers D, B, C, A: /cast hidden votes/
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-right.fa-border
          Leader: "Ok, revealing the vote!"
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-left.fa-border
          (The vote is A:10, B:10, C:8, D:13)
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-right.fa-border
          Leader: "Looks like we have a consensus value of 10. Developers C and D, are you in agreement with that?"
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-left.fa-border
          (Developers C and D have a chance to explain)
        %li
          %i.fa.fa-angle-double-right.fa-border
          Leader: "OK, looks like this is a 10. On to the next task!"
          %br
          %small (The leader could also reset the vote and start over)

      %h4.marker The Planning Process

      %p
        Users choose a handle before entering the application.

      %p
        Upon entering the application, users arrive at the Lobby where they
        can chat, create a new planning room, or enter an existing planning
        room.

      %p
        Planning rooms are where the real work of the application is done.
        The user who created the room is given the Admin privilege by default,
        allowing them to close and/or reset the vote at any time.

      %p
        In the planning room, users discuss the item that they are trying to
        estimate, then vote for the complexity of the item under discussion, from 0
        (lowest/trivial) to âˆž (highest/impossible). They may cast and change their
        votes at any time during the discussion; votes are hidden from view until
        the Admin user closes the vote and reveals the result. (The secret vote
        avoids biasing group opinion.)

      %p
        The Admin user closes the vote and displays the winning selection by clicking
        the button in the administrative controls. When the vote is closed, the application
        tallies the results to see if one selection has more votes than any other.
        If such a winner exists, that result is deemed the "consensus" value. If not,
        the result is "no consensus" - the Admin attempts consensus again by resetting
        the vote and reopening discussion.

      %p
        In the spirit of collaboration, the Admin privilege is not strictly enforced;
        any user may "take" the Admin privilege at any time.
