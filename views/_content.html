<h4 class='marker'>About this Application</h4>
<p>
For developers who have done software planning in an Agile process,
this application should feel familiar. The application provides
a collaborative space for developers to discuss, vote, and
reach consensus on the complexity of a task. For example:
</p>
<ul class='fa-ul'>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-right fa-border'></i>
Leader: "The next task under discussion is WIDGET-193, adding a 'like' button to the widget interface"
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-left fa-border'></i>
Developer A: "Does this include the 'like' frontend and backend?"
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-right fa-border'></i>
Leader: "Yes - good clarification. Any other questions?"
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-left fa-border'></i>
Developers A, B, C, D: "Nope. All set!"
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-right fa-border'></i>
Leader: "OK, let's vote."
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-left fa-border'></i>
Developers D, B, C, A: /cast hidden votes/
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-right fa-border'></i>
Leader: "Ok, revealing the vote!"
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-left fa-border'></i>
(The vote is A:10, B:10, C:8, D:13)
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-right fa-border'></i>
Leader: "Looks like we have a consensus value of 10. Developers C and D, are you in agreement with that?"
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-left fa-border'></i>
(Developers C and D have a chance to explain)
</li>
<li>
<i class='fa fa-angle-double-right fa-border'></i>
Leader: "OK, looks like this is a 10. On to the next task!"
<br>
<small>(The leader could also reset the vote and start over)</small>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 class='marker'>The Planning Process</h4>
<p>
Users choose a handle before entering the application.
</p>
<p>
Upon entering the application, users arrive at the Lobby where they
can chat, create a new planning room, or enter an existing planning
room.
</p>
<p>
Planning rooms are where the real work of the application is done.
The user who created the room is given the Admin privilege by default,
allowing them to close and/or reset the vote at any time.
</p>
<p>
In the planning room, users discuss the item that they are trying to
estimate, then vote for the complexity of the item under discussion, from 0
(lowest/trivial) to âˆž (highest/impossible). They may cast and change their
votes at any time during the discussion; votes are hidden from view until
the Admin user closes the vote and reveals the result. (The secret vote
avoids biasing group opinion.)
</p>
<p>
The Admin user closes the vote and displays the winning selection by clicking
the button in the administrative controls. When the vote is closed, the application
tallies the results to see if one selection has more votes than any other.
If such a winner exists, that result is deemed the "consensus" value. If not,
the result is "no consensus" - the Admin attempts consensus again by resetting
the vote and reopening discussion.
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of collaboration, the Admin privilege is not strictly enforced;
any user may "take" the Admin privilege at any time.
